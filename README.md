# Related Files Extension

Are you, like me, sick of having to use the entire file tree view to find extension files related to the file you are viewing? No more! This extension will display a view with related files in the sidebar. Lazy navigation between node and json extensions has never been easier.

## Usage

- Open a file in the editor.
- The extension will automatically show related files in the sidebar.
- Click on a related file to open it.
